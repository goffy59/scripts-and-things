# scripts-and-things
An assortment of scripts and things I make or use on fedora and debian based linux distros.

Example 1 for auto-apt-updater if you are hosting this on your webserver with http auth, remove -u 'user:pass' if no http auth: "curl -u 'user:pass' -sSL https://subdomain.domain.com/folder/auto-apt-updater.sh | sudo bash"
